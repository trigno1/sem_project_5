## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Phygital NFT Platform seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us immediately.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to **[tanishpareek2005@gmail.com](mailto:tanishpareek2005@gmail.com)**.

### What to Include
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

### Our Commitment
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- We will provide a regular update on the status of your report.
- We will notify you once the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you follow responsible disclosure guidelines and give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before making any information public.

### Smart Contract Security
Note that this project interacts with the **Base Sepolia Testnet**. While it's a testnet, we still value the security of the integration logic and smart contract interactions. If you find issues related to private key handling, signature verification, or gas optimization vulnerabilities, please include those in your report.

### Application Security Measures

The platform implements several hardened security layers:

- **Signature-Based Wallet Authentication** — Sensitive endpoints require cryptographic proof of wallet ownership via `x-signature` and `x-address` headers
- **Server-Side Input Validation** — All API inputs are validated server-side before processing
- **Structured Error Handling** — Internal error details are masked from API responses; only standardized error codes (`ERR_API_xxx`, `ERR_AUTH_xxx`, etc.) are exposed
- **Data Masking** — Sensitive fields like drop passwords are excluded from public API responses
- **Environment Variable Isolation** — Private keys and secrets live exclusively in server-side environment variables, never exposed to the client bundle
